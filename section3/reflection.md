## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I really struggled with the Pomodoro method. I felt like I would start getting into the swing of things, start making good progress, then I had to walk away. Then when I came back it took a few minutes to remember where I was, and I would just start to feel momentum, when I had to leave again. After feeling really frustrated for a few cycles I  decided to increase the working time, and keep the break time the same. I have always been a head down kind of learner and worker. I can spend hours on a project and as long as I am engaged, I feel like I retain more from longer periods of concentration.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

Everything took longer than I expected using the pomodoro method because I felt like I had to relearn everything I was doing before I could start again. I felt more distracted by whatever was going on when I would walk away from my machine.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A hash associates a key to a value, rather than just creating an ordered list like an array.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

```
pet_store = {
  "gold fish": 33 ,
  "gerbils": 12 ,
  "cat food": 15 ,
  "dog food": 10
}
```

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
```
states["IA"]
```
6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
```
states.keys
states.values
```
7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

If you were storing Usernames and passwords. Each username is associated with one password and the hash can confirm that they go together.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?

I want to use hashes in a practical application. I think I understand them in theory, but to see them in action for a practical purpose I think will solidify the concept in my mind.
