## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I usually wait too long. I enjoy the satisfaction of finding things out on my own and tend to work longer on my own before reaching out to ask questions.
